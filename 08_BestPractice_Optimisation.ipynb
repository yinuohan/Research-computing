    "# Optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the code we initiially write to solve a problem is primarily focused on accuracy but often once this is achieved we would like to find ways to make the code run faster.  Python isn't the best code to do this but we will we will use it to investigate the process for optimising code.  We will revisit this when we learn cython.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand how to make code faster it can be useful to know the basics of how a computer works. Most computers have an architecture that looks a bit like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Plots/Computer_architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern CPU's are so fast that actually most optimisatising for high performance computing comes from two approaches: 1. optimising memory usage to make sure the CPU is fed with enough data 2. utilising parallelisation which we will meet next.  There are three numbers listed for each section in the above plot: Latency, which is how long it takes to respond to a command; Bandwidth, which is how fast it can pass data up the chain; Size, which is how much data can be stored there.  The main problem we see is that memory latency is ~200 times longer than CPU latency (which is 1 cycle).  So, if you want to multiply two numbers it takes 200 times as long to get them to the CPU as it does to multiply them.  The response to this was to introduce multiple layers of faster and faster, but smaller and smaller, memory inbetween the CPU and main memory called 'cache'.  This helps keep data that we are working on close to the CPU so if we want to use it we can without delay.  This is a problem that is getting worse with time as we can see in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Plots/cpuvsmem.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that there are two things we can do to speed up our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep data local, ie near the CPU, and \n",
    "- reuse it as much as possible while it is there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously you have no direct control over the cache but there are some things you can do that help the computer optimise this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best analogy for a computer is trying to learn something from textbooks.  Now the heirarchy looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Plots/Library.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And it is easy to get some basic lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get all the books you need from the library at once because it's a pain to keep going back there\n",
    "- Constantly swapping books is annoying so try to finish working on the open ones before you look at the next set\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind lets look at what we can do to optimise our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, in python we don't actually have much control over what the computer does at the instruction level.  This is a shame as often it is possible to speed up some calculations by orders of magnitude just by using simple directives to compilers in lower level languages like C and Fortran.  This is why it is so important to use packages in python where this type of optimisation should already have been done for you.  Another key point is that you should try to use packages what have been build for your CPU (check this with `lscpu`), for example making sure you install the intel distribution for intel chips with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create -n idp intelpython3_full python=3`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timing operations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are always many different ways to do the same calculation so you should get into the habit of checking which is fastest.  For simple commands and functions we can just use `%timeit` (single line) and `%%timeit` (entire cell) which are useful for comparing equvilent code.  The best bit is they run the code multiple times to give you an accurate estimate of time.  Here are some examples of simple small speedups you can do:\n"

    "Strictly speaking on a CPU addition is faster than multiplication which is faster than division.  Exponentiation is not a basic operation for the CPU and instead calls a function which takes the log then multiplies.  However, in python we see that while exponentiation is slower than multiplying, multipling is the same as adding.  Multiplying by a number is faster than multiplying by a variable as we don't have to go and find the number it in memory and multipling two numbers much faster again.  We can roughly conclude that it takes twice as long to find a variable as it does to multiply it (you can read faster than find the right bit of a book). In python division and muliplication take the same time.  This is because most of the time is lost in finding the variables rather than the operation itself.  But if we do the operation alot:"

Do be careful with this as it can make code very hard to read so you should generally aviod it.  Also note that subsequent operations on list1 may be quicker for the last 2 methods as the list is more likely to be contiguous in memory (all in the same place) for very large lists so we can read it to cache faster.   Finally, note that using a list comprehension won't make you code fast if you use bad algorithms like `x**2` rather than `x*x` which costs ~5 times as much.
