    "So just adding `%%cython` gives us a factor ~2x speedup.  But if we simply add types to our variables with `cdef` this increases to a ~240x speed up!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the function is dominated by the loop which C can do much better.  The `%%cython` magic actually does something tricky in the background. It takes the cell and converts it to C code then compiles it and stores the resulting executable in a temporary location.  We can see the actuall C code generated using the annotate option by adding `-a` after the `%%cython`.  This gives us a window to how the code has been converted to C with highlighting to show how much python interaction is left for each line.   If we click the little '+' on the line number it shows you what this line has been converted to in C and the stronger the yellow the more python interation remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will come back to compilation later but let's look at the difference between writing cython and python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We don't have to do anything to cython-ise most python code.  We can put almost any python code through the cython compiler and it will work fine and usually run faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To access performance of C with Cython we usually only have to declare types using `cdef` and sometimes switch the default behaviour of some operations using simple flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In cython we can now use all C libraries and easily access threaded parallelisim by avoiding the GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that there are very few differences.  Cython is a superset of python so we don't have to change anything if we don't want to.  As cython is effectivly an optimisation tool we should profile the code and only cythonise the slowest parts.  This is the main advantage. If you wanted to access the speed of C you would otherwise have to re-write all your code in C where lots of things can be significantly more difficult.  Instead we can use the convenience of python for most of the code and only invoke C in the sections where performance is most important.\n",
